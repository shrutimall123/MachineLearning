## Dataset: [states.csv]

## Overview:
This dataset documents all United Nations General Assembly votes since its establishment in 1946. The data is broken into three different files: the first lists each UN resolution, subject, and vote records; the second records individual member state votes per resolution; and the third provides an annual summary of member state voting records with affinity scores and an ideal point estimate in relation to the United States.

# Contents:
- **affinity_score_comparison.html**: HTML file containing visualizations of affinity score comparisons.
  
- **MLCAC_032.html**: HTML file for the analysis notebook.
  
- **MLCAC_032.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data visualization, cleaning, and modeling.
  
- **MLCAC_032.pdf**: PDF version of the analysis notebook.
  
- **states.csv**: CSV file containing the raw data.
  
# Data Preprocessing:
**Data Cleaning**: The dataset underwent thorough cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

# Data Visualization:
Various visualizations were generated to understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns within the data.
The affinity_score_comparison.html file contains visualizations specifically focused on comparing affinity scores.

# Machine Learning Models:
Several machine learning models were utilized to analyze the dataset:

- **Linear Regression**: Used to establish relationships between dependent and independent variables.
 
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Employed for classification tasks due to its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets.
  
- **K-means**: Utilized for clustering similar data points together.

- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: Implemented for time series analysis and forecasting.
